# Budget instead of estimate

# Avoid using numeric story sizes

# Estimate capacity based on rolling number of stories

# Estimate capactity based on analysis time

# Pick impacts instead of prioritising stories

# Never say 'no' - say 'not now'

# Split UX improvements form consistency work

# Get end-users to opt in to large user interface changes

# Throw stories away after they are deliverty
